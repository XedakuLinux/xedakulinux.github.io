# The Xedaku Linux distribution
Xedaku Linux is a Linux distribution based off of Alpine Linux. Our main focus is for minimal bloat and simplicity, so your device has all the resources available.

Xedaku is meant for embedded devices and servers; if you're a normal end user, Xedaku probably isn't for you. [Unless if you want to tinker :)]

The rootfs can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/XedakuLinux/Xedaku)
